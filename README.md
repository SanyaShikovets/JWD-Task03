OOP & Information Handling

You need to create a console application with the next functionalities.

The application can read a correctly formatted XML-file and create a tree structure of objects that stores information from this file. The application can use any of a valid XML-file.

Also, the application must use this structure for printing information to console (preferably in a formatted form).

You need to develop the special entities and design relationships between them.

Use only input-output classes reading the information from the file (not standard Java XML parsers).

Use a layered architecture, correctly handle the exceptions and not do long unreadable methods.

For example, 
For this XML-file:

<breakfast-menu>
    <food id="1">
        <name>Belgian Waffles</name>
        <price>$5.95</price>
    </food>
    <food id="2">
        <name>Strawberry Belgian Waffles</name>
        <price>$7.95</price>
    </food>
</breakfast-menu>
